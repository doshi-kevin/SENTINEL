# 📊 Understanding Your Extracted Data

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully extracted and organized the DARPA Transparent Computing data! Here's what you have:

---

## 📁 Your Data Files

### 1. **events.csv** - System Actions (Most Important!)
**What it contains:** Every action performed on the Windows system
- Reading files
- Writing data
- Executing programs
- Network communications
- Registry modifications

**Key Columns:**
- `timestamp` - When the action happened
- `event_type` - What kind of action (EVENT_READ, EVENT_WRITE, EVENT_EXECUTE, etc.)
- `subject` - UUID of the process that did the action
- `predicate_object` - UUID of what was affected (file, network, etc.)
- `size` - Size of data involved

**How to use it:**
- Sort by timestamp to see sequence of events
- Filter by event_type to find specific actions
- Look for unusual patterns around attack times
- This is your primary data for detecting attacks!

---

### 2. **subjects.csv** - Processes/Programs
**What it contains:** Every process (running program) on the system
- chrome.exe, firefox.exe, powershell.exe, etc.
- Parent-child relationships between processes
- When each process started

**Key Columns:**
- `uuid` - Unique ID for this process
- `cid` - Process ID (PID)
- `cmd_line` - Full command that started the process
- `parent_subject` - UUID of parent process
- `privilege_level` - Admin rights or normal user

**How to use it:**
- Match UUIDs with events.csv to see what each process did
- Follow parent-child chains to see how processes spawned
- Look for suspicious process names or command lines
- Check privilege escalation (normal user → admin)

---

### 3. **network.csv** - Network Connections
**What it contains:** Every network connection made
- Outbound connections to servers
- Inbound connections
- Ports used
- Protocols (TCP, UDP)

**Key Columns:**
- `uuid` - Unique ID for this connection
- `local_address` & `local_port` - Your computer's end
- `remote_address` & `remote_port` - Server being connected to
- `ip_protocol` - Type of connection (6=TCP, 17=UDP)

**How to use it:**
- Match UUIDs with events.csv to see network activity
- Look for connections to suspicious IPs
- Check for unusual ports
- Find Command & Control (C2) server connections

**What it contains:** Registry key access/modifications
- System settings
- Software configurations
- Persistence mechanisms

**Key Columns:**
- `uuid` - Unique ID

## 🔗 How the Data Connects

### The Provenance Graph Concept

Think of it like this:

```
Subject (Process)  →  Event (Action)  →  Object (File/Network)
    firefox.exe    →   EVENT_WRITE    →    config.json

Who did it?          What happened?      What was affected?
```

### Following the Trail

**Example Attack Scenario:**

1. **Initial Access:**
   ```
   events.csv: EVENT_EXECUTE
   subject: outlook.exe (email client)
   object: malware.exe
   → Email attachment executed!
   ```

2. **Execution:**
   ```
   subjects.csv: 
   uuid: abc123
   cmd_line: malware.exe
   parent: outlook.exe
   → New malicious process spawned
   ```

3. **Persistence:**
   ```
   events.csv: EVENT_WRITE
   subject: malware.exe
   object: registry key "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Run"
   → Setting up to run on startup
   ```

4. **Command & Control:**
   ```
   events.csv: EVENT_CONNECT
   subject: malware.exe
   object: network connection to 10.0.0.5:443
   
   network.csv:
   remote_address: 10.0.0.5
   remote_port: 443
   → Calling home to attacker server
   ```

5. **Data Exfiltration:**
   ```
   events.csv: EVENT_READ
   subject: malware.exe
   object: confidential_data.pdf
   
   Then:
   
   events.csv: EVENT_SENDTO
   subject: malware.exe
   object: network to 10.0.0.5
   → Stealing data!
   ```

## 📖 How to Explore Your Data

### In Excel/Google Sheets

**Step 1: Open events.csv**

**Step 2: Basic Exploration**
- Sort by timestamp (oldest to newest)
- Use AutoFilter (Data → Filter)
- Create pivot tables

**Step 3: Find Attack Patterns**

**Look for these suspicious patterns:**

1. **Unusual Processes:**
   - Filter event_type = EVENT_EXECUTE
   - Look for weird process names
   - Check processes running from temp folders

2. **Network Activity:**
   - Filter event_type = EVENT_CONNECT, EVENT_SENDTO
   - Look for unusual IPs
   - Check for connections to suspicious ports

3. **File Operations:**
   - Filter event_type = EVENT_WRITE
   - Look for files being created in system folders
   - Check for executables being written

4. **Registry Changes:**
   - Look at registry.csv
   - Check for Run keys
   - Find persistence mechanisms

**Step 4: Cross-Reference with Ground Truth**

Open the ground truth PDF and find:
- What attacks were performed?
- When did they happen?
- What hosts were affected?

Then search your CSV files for those times/indicators!

## 💡 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. UUIDs Link Everything
Every entity has a UUID (unique ID). Use these to connect:
- Events → Subjects
- Events → Objects
- Subjects → Parents
- Objects → Network/Files

### 2. Timestamps Show Sequence
- Events happen in order
- Following timestamps = following the attack
- Look for patterns over time

### 3. Event Types Tell the Story
- EVENT_EXECUTE = Program started
- EVENT_READ = Data accessed
- EVENT_WRITE = Data modified
- EVENT_SENDTO = Network transmission

### 4. Provenance = History
Tracking where data came from and where it went.

## 📊 Quick Analysis Ideas

### 1. Timeline of Activity
```
In Excel:
- Select timestamp column
- Insert → Line Chart
- See activity over time
```

### 2. Most Common Event Types
```
In Excel:
- Insert → Pivot Table
- Rows: event_type
- Values: Count of event_type
```

### 3. Process Activity
```
- Filter events.csv by subject UUID
- See all actions by one process
- Follow its behavior
```

### 4. Network Connections Timeline
```
- Filter event_type for network events
- Sort by timestamp
- See connection patterns
```
